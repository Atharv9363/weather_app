## Project Title

Weather App

## Description

This project is a weather application that allows users to search for weather conditions in specific locations. It provides current weather information including temperature, humidity, and weather description.

## Features

- User-friendly interface with search bar for location input.
- Displays real-time weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.
- Responsive design that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Integration with OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.
- Frontend built using React and backend using Express.
- Deployed on a cloud-based platform.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, Framer Motion for animations, Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Backend: Express.js for building RESTful APIs.
- Deployment: Hosted on Vercel (Front-end) and Render (Back-end).

## Folder Structure

- `frontend`: Contains the React frontend code.
- `backend`: Contains the Express backend code.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the frontend server: `npm start`
4. Open another terminal window/tab.
5. Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`
6. Install dependencies: `npm install`
7. Start the backend server: `npm run de` or `npm start`

## Frontend Code

The frontend is built using React, Framer Motion for animations, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It includes two main components:

- `Form`: Allows users to input a location and initiate the search.
- `WeatherData`: Displays the retrieved weather information.

## Backend Code

The backend is built using Express.js. It provides a single endpoint `/` that accepts POST requests with a `city` parameter in the request body. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the provided city name.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on AWS, ensuring it is accessible from any device with an internet connection.

## Future Improvements

- Add more weather details like wind speed, sunrise/sunset times.
- Implement user authentication and personalized weather preferences.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my proficiency in React, Express, API integration, and cloud deployment. The use of animations and responsive design enhances user experience. Feel free to explore the codebase and provide feedback.

Your documentation should provide a clear overview of your project, its features, technologies used, and how to run it. Make sure to replace placeholders (like `<repository_url>`) with actual values. By presenting your project professionally and thoroughly, you can impress recruiters and anyone interested in your work.
